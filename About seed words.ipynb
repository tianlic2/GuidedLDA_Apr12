    "we can see after stemming, `'environment'` will be converted to `'environ'`.`'environmental'` will be converted to `'environment'`. How seed words work is different from Boolean search. Let's say we have two different forms of words: one is original form, which appears in the data before text-cleaning. The other is stem form, which appears in the data after text cleaning, and this form is also the form we used in guidedLDA model (seed words & our corpus). Maybe I misused the word `capture`, which caused misunderstanding, sorry for that. The seed words and words in our corpus are one-to-one corresponding. `'environ'` can only capture `'environ'` in our corpus. Each seed word can only capture **one** word in corpus. However, `'environ'` is not the word we want, we need to interpret what it refers to in the original form, maybe `'environment'` and `'environmental'`?. Here is the problem, sometimes a stem word can refer to only one word, but sometimes can refer to multiple words in original form. For example, `'consum'` can refer to both `'consumer'` and `'consume'`. When I said `'environment'` **can not** capture `'environment'` but can only capture `'environmental'`, I mean `'environment'` in the seed words does not refer to `'environment'` but refers to `'environmental'`. Same as `'climatechang'` and `'climate'`: `'climat'` can only capture `'climat'`, and it refers to `'climate'` in the original text. `'climatechang'` can only capture `'climatechang'` in the corpus, and it refers to `'climatechange'`, because the stem form of `'climatechange'` is `'climatechang'`, but not `'climat'`. One thing is for sure: no two words in the seed word list will refer to a same word in the original text. In short, **one seed word captured one word in corpus, one seed word may refers to one or more words in the original text.**"
